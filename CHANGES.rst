- Merge pull request #239 from ShopRunner/atomic-experiment-creation.
  [Zack Kitzmiller]

  Ensure atomic experiment creation.
- Ensure atomic experiment creation. [Mark Williams]

  The transaction wrapping the creation of experiment keys in
  Experiment.save did not watch any of those keys.  Consequently
  parallel writers could cause duplicate writes against an
  experiment's mutable values, such as its alternatives list.

  This adds a watch guard to the experiment's key. Note that
  Experiment.is_new_record now checks the existence of the
  experiment's key rather than its membership in the experiments
  set; this is so that the code watches a value unique to the
  experiment and not one shared by all.

  On conflict the experiment's traffic fraction is persisted.

- Merge pull request #157 from phjardas/check_traffic_fraction. [Zack
  Kitzmiller]

  Do not check traffic fraction for update on every participation.
- Added unit tests. [Philipp Jardas]

  Redis database is now flushed after every test.
- Do not check traffic fraction for update on every participation.
  [Philipp Jardas]

  If a participation is requested without a traffic fraction argument, the traffic fraction is no longer assumed to be 1. This caused requests to always fail for experiments with a traffic fraction lower than 1 without explicit argument.

  Further, the server no longer defaults the request parameter "traffic_fraction" to 1 but simply leaves it at None. It's up to the model to default this value to 1 only when creating an new experiment.
- Merge pull request #189 from seatgeek/josegonzalez-patch-2. [Zack
  Kitzmiller]

  Catch ValueError during g_stat calculation
- Catch ValueError during g_stat calculation. [Jose Diaz-Gonzalez]

  There can be cases where the conversions for a given alternative are zero, resulting in a math domain error when taking the log of the value.
- Merge branch 'blackskad-issue-166' [zackkitzmiller]

  Conflicts:

- Discard conversions from excluded clients when traffic_fraction < 1.
  [Thomas Meire]

  When traffic_fraction is < 1, some clients get the control alternative.
  The participations of these excluded clients are not recorded to redis.
  When there is a conversion request for an excluded client, the conversion
  is not discarded and recorded to redis. When there are a couple of these
  conversions by excluded clients, the number of completed conversions
  becomes bigger than the number of participants, which should never be
  possible. The computation of the confidence_interval relies on this
  assumption and fails when the completed_count becomes bigger than
  participant_count.

  The solution is to discard the conversions of excluded clients as well.

  * You can use sixpack within a python app with `sixpack.participate(...)`

- Bump version. [zackkitzmiller]
- Merge pull request #116 from seatgeek/client-chosen-alternative. [Zack
  Kitzmiller]

  Allow clients to choose an alternative
- Allow clients to choose an alternative. [Eric Waller]

  Useful for situations where you may not know if a test will be encountered until it's too late to rely on asynchronously choosing an alternative.

  For example, when testing the behavior of a button, if `participate` is called when the button is setup, users that never click the button will dilute the results, thus requiring more participations to reach significance.

  find_or_404 should only catch ValueError.
- Find_or_404 should only catch ValueError. [Dan Horrigan]

  By catching all errors it makes it very hard to debug.  For example, if
  the Redis service craps out in the middle of the request, a 404 will be
  returned instead of a 500, which means the exception will be silently
  ignored, and not being logged correctly.

  Eliminate a number of extra redis requests
- Duplicate conversions aren't exceptional. [Eric Waller]
- Experiment.winner is now a cached property. [Eric Waller]
- Re-order alternative choosing precedence. [Eric Waller]

  New precedence ordering:
  * The force param
  * If the server is not enabled, the control is returned
  * If there's a winner, it's returned
  * If the visitor is excluded, return the control
  * Otherwise create an internal client_id and return a "chosen" alternative

  This ensures the following:
  * Bots do not cause internal client_ids to be created
  * Bots *do* get the winner if one exists
  * The force param *always* works
  * Redis work is minimized
- Fix bug with returning the winner. [Eric Waller]
